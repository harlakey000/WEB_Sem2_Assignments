I love you
Three words I don't say anymore
Maybe because my heart is torn
It's taped up and it's stapled
I don't know if I'm able

To move on as I should
I'm watching you leave again
And it replays in my head
A million times and I can't take it
My heart is breaking once more

Picking my mind up off the floor
Will I put it back in my skull?
No, not ever
'Cause you said we were forever
Huh, that's some fable

But I can't move on as I should
I'm watching you leave again
And it replays in my head
A million times and I can't take it
My heart is breaking once more
